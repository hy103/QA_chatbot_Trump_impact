As the 4-year term for the current democratic \\npresident comes to an end, elections have been announced. The incumbent president, \\nJoe Biden, a member of the Democratic Party, initially ran for re-elections and became \\nthe party's presumptive nominee, facing little opposition. However, Biden's \\nperformance in the June 2024 presidential debate intensified concerns about his ability \\nto continue, and led to calls within his party for him to leave the race. \\n \\nMr Biden withdrew on 21st July and endorsed Vice President Ms Kamala Harris, who \\nbecame the party's nominee on August 5. Ms Harris selected Mr Tim Walz, the \\ngovernor of Minnesota, as her running mate. On the Republican side, Mr Donald Trump \\nwas nominated along with his running mate, JD Vance, Ohio senator. Mr Trump has \\nrecently seen many legal hurdles and also faced two assassination attempts in July and \\nSeptember.   \\n \\nSince most US states are strongly affiliated with one party due to their demographics, \\nthey rarely face competition. Therefore, swing states ? those with a negligible \\ndifference in their vote share ? are those that have a significant influence on the \\noutcome. In 2020 elections, seven states were won by a margin of three percentage \\npoint (pp) or less.
